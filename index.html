<h1>Greetings from Berkeley!</h1>

<p> I've been busy with astronomy projects, writing, and speaking.
Because of this, I'm unable to answer all my e-mail ... I read it all,
but I just can't answer every letter.  In advance, my apologies.
<p>
To try to head off some questions, here are some answers to common questions:
<p>

You can get the scoop on my first book, 
<a href="cuckoos_egg.html">
Cuckoo's Egg </a>.<p>

My next book is 
<a href="silicon_snake_oil.html">
Silicon Snake Oil</a>.  It's about astronomy,
computers, the Internet, and getting lost in a cave.
<p>

Or come here me speak this spring. My
<a href="travel.html">
travel schedule </a>
puts me in a dozen cities.
<p>

For astrophysics, check out my recent
